      <p><a href="https://vestafinance.xyz/">Vesta Finance</a> was a project that I co-founded in 2022.</p>
      <section>

        <h3>Before launch</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Identified market trend and saw a need for a multi-collateral stablecoin</li>
          <li>Mapped out needed resources for engineering and marketing, recruited accordingly</li>
          <li>Set out a product roadmap for the initial launch taking into consideration of the market trend</li>
          <li>Designed the UI for <a href="https://vestafinance.xyz/">v1</a> in 1 month</li>
          <li>Built a lore-driven marketing strategy, gaining 20k Discord members and 30k Twitter followers in 3 months organically</li>
          <li>Networked and raised a <a href="https://medium.com/@VestaFinance/announcing-our-angel-round-a75b25a67a7d">$1.5M seed round</a></li>
          <li>Launched the first product according to plan, reaching $70M in TVL in a week, raising $10m from token sale</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>After launch</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Scaled the team to 10 people across marketing, engineering, and operations</li>
          <li>Led product effort - built a highly adaptive market roadmap, iterating every quarter with hundreds of user research sessions to ensure that the product is always aligned with the market trend</li>
          <li>Led design effort - designed the <a href="https://vesta-app-v2.vercel.app/">v2</a> UI for the Vesta app</li>
          <li>Led business development efforts, drove product defining partnerships such as strong deals with <a href="https://curia.vestafinance.xyz/t/passed-olympus-vesta-partnership-formalisation/52">Olympus</a> and <a href="https://curia.vestafinance.xyz/t/passed-glp-collateral-listing/64">GMX</a>, directly resulting in $1m+ in profits</li>
          <li>Navigated complex stakeholder landscape of engineering, legal, investors and users to implement critical pricing change, achieving 8x revenue growth while preserving 95% of deposits.</li>
          <li>Collaborated with the Arbitrum ecosystem strategically, resulting in <a href="https://curia.vestafinance.xyz/t/rfc-proposal-for-utilizing-arb-airdrop-to-foster-growth-and-establish-vesta-as-a-key-player-on-arbitrum/222">$5M in profits</a></li>
          <li>Pioneered the first <a href="https://curia.vestafinance.xyz/t/rfc-new-interest-rate-framework/274">real-time market-trailing interest rate mechanism</a> for a stablecoin, navigated complex stakeholder landscape of engineering, legal, investors and users to implement the design, achieving 8x revenue growth while preserving 95% of deposits.</li>
          <li>Pioneered a collateral strategy that <a href="https://curia.vestafinance.xyz/t/passed-glp-collateral-listing/64">returns yield to users</a>, resulting in 70% increase in TVL and $500,000 in profits</li>
          <li>Ultimate sunset resulted in more than <a href="https://curia.vestafinance.xyz/t/closed-sunset-of-vestas-protocol-action-plan-proposal/359">$14M in capital back to investors</a>, more than $2M than originally raised</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What I learned</h2>
        <p>TL;DR</p>
        <p>Vesta failed to achieve significant product-market fit due to artificial initial traction from token emissions, misaligned user expectations, and internal misalignment. Internal challenges was ultimately the cause of the project's demise, including lack of solid product development processes and cultural misalignment. Despite these issues, Vesta returned $14M in capital back to investors, more than $2M than raised. To read more about what I learned, please refer to my in-depth analysis of Vesta's dissolution below.</p>
